# Overflow Indicator

Overflow Indicator is a lightweight JavaScript library that helps to detect and highlight overflowing tabs in a container. This is especially useful for responsive designs where the number of tabs might exceed the available screen width, making some tabs scrollable and potentially hidden from view.
